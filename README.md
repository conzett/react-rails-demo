React-rails demo
================

https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails

1. `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
2. `bundle exec rake db:seed`
3. `bundle exec rails s`

You will need a JavaScript runtime environment for pre-rendering, if one isn't
present on your system, you may have to add `therubyracer` to your gemfile.
